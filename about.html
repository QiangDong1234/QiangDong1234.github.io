        <h2>Qiang's About Me</h2>
	Hi everyone, my name is Qiang Dong, and my pronouns are he/him. I’m currently a freshman, <br>
and I’m majoring in computer science and Chinese. I write because I think writing is one of the skills <br>
that can be used for a lifetime. Also, The core commonality between writing articles and writing code <br>
is that they require the ability to think clearly. The top software engineers are often good writers, <br>
and their writing is as logical as the code, with smooth and elegant prose.
