        <h1>SOVIET MISSILE DODGE</h1>
	<br>
	<p>

	<font size="4"> This is my collaborative final project for CSC 106.<br>
	<br>
	This project is a simple side-scrolling bullet hell game in which you take control of a small biplane and attempt<br> to dodge comically oversized munitions headed your way!
	Use the space bar to keep the plane in the air, <br>if you hit the ground or suffer 3 hits by a missile, you're dead!

	<h1>THE STORY</h1>
	<br>

	<p>
	<font size="4">
	It is February 1949. The German Reich won the Second World War, and the Soviet Union has fallen far, with the Germans<br> taking territory up to Moscow and the Japanese taking territory in Siberia.
	There seems to be little hope left for the state to continue functioning.
	<br>
	<br>
	However, recent events (mainly the death of The Fuhrer himself) have given Soviet resistance members a chance to<br> band together and strike back at their oppressors. You are a spy pilot for the resistance and have just finished a mission stealing<br> blueprints from the German Reich that is planning to create a nuclear weapon. You must bring these blueprints to headquarters,<br> but as you take off, you are assaulted by newly-operational German missile systems that span miles in the snow.
	<br>
	<br>
	Can you survive the onslaught of hundreds of missiles and bring the plans back to the Motherland?
